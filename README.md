# DuoTone Dark Space Theme

A double-hue syntax theme for Atom.

![DuoTone](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-dark-space-syntax/raw/master/docs/screenshot.png)

DuoTone themes use only 2 hues (8 shades in total). It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.

## Language support

DuoTone themes are optimized for many languages:

> C, Clojure, CoffeeScript, C#, CSS, GF Markdown, Go, Haskell, HTML, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Less, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, SASS, SCSS, Stylus, XML, YAML...

See the list of [all languages](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-syntax/tree/master/styles/languages).


## Variations

Here a list of all [DuoTone themes](https://atom.io/themes/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=keyword:duotone). Or at least the ones that have the `duotone` keyword added. :grin:
